<doc><id>473</id><url>https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/library/errno.html</url><title> --- 标准 errno 系统符号</title><body>本模块提供标准的 errno 系统符号。每个符号的值是其对应的整数值。符号的名称和描述来自 linux/include/errno.h，应该是非常全面的。
提供从 errno 值到底层系统中字符串名称的映射的字典。例如， errno.errorcode[errno.EPERM] 映射为 'EPERM' 。
如果要将数字的错误代码转换为错误信息，请使用 os.strerror()。
在下面的列表中，当前平台上没有使用的符号没有被本模块定义。 已定义的符号的具体列表可参见 errno.errorcode.keys()。 可用的符号包括：
Operation not permitted
No such file or directory
No such process
Interrupted system call.
