This module implements an interface to the crypt(3) routine, which is
a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm; see the Unix man
page for further details.  Possible uses include storing hashed passwords
so you can check passwords without storing the actual password, or attempting
to crack Unix passwords with a dictionary.
Notice that the behavior of this module depends on the actual implementation  of
the crypt(3) routine in the running system.  Therefore, any
extensions available on the current implementation will also  be available on
this module.
Availability: Unix. Not available on VxWorks.
3.3 新版功能.
The crypt module defines the list of hashing methods (not all methods
are available on all platforms):
A Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 86 character
hash based on the SHA-512 hash function.  This is the strongest method.
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 16 character salt and 43
character hash based on the SHA-256 hash function.
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 22 character salt and 31
character hash based on the Blowfish cipher.
3.7 新版功能.
Another Modular Crypt Format method with 8 character salt and 22
character hash based on the MD5 hash function.
The traditional method with a 2 character salt and 13 characters of
hash.  This is the weakest method.
3.3 新版功能.
A list of available password hashing algorithms, as
crypt.METHOD_* objects.  This list is sorted from strongest to
weakest.
The crypt module defines the following functions:
word will usually be a user's password as typed at a prompt or  in a graphical
interface.  The optional salt is either a string as returned from
mksalt(), one of the crypt.METHOD_* values (though not all
may be available on all platforms), or a full encrypted password
including salt, as returned by this function.  If salt is not
provided, the strongest method will be used (as returned by
methods()).
Checking a password is usually done by passing the plain-text password
as word and the full results of a previous crypt() call,
which should be the same as the results of this call.
salt (either a random 2 or 16 character string, possibly prefixed with
$digit$ to indicate the method) which will be used to perturb the
encryption algorithm.  The characters in salt must be in the set
[./a-zA-Z0-9], with the exception of Modular Crypt Format which
prefixes a $digit$.
Returns the hashed password as a string, which will be composed of
characters from the same alphabet as the salt.
Since a few crypt(3) extensions allow different values, with
different sizes in the salt, it is recommended to use  the full crypted
password as salt when checking for a password.
在 3.3 版更改: Accept crypt.METHOD_* values in addition to strings for salt.
Return a randomly generated salt of the specified method.  If no
method is given, the strongest method available as returned by
methods() is used.
The return value is a string suitable for passing as the salt argument
to crypt().
rounds specifies the number of rounds for METHOD_SHA256,
METHOD_SHA512 and METHOD_BLOWFISH.
For METHOD_SHA256 and METHOD_SHA512 it must be an integer between
1000 and 999_999_999, the default is 5000.  For
METHOD_BLOWFISH it must be a power of two between 16 (24)
and 2_147_483_648 (231), the default is 4096
(212).
3.3 新版功能.
在 3.7 版更改: Added the rounds parameter.
A simple example illustrating typical use (a constant-time comparison
operation is needed to limit exposure to timing attacks.
hmac.compare_digest() is suitable for this purpose):
To generate a hash of a password using the strongest available method and
check it against the original:
