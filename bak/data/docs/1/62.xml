关于这些函数的更多信息可以在平台 API 文档中找到。
该模块实现了控制台 I/O API 的普通和宽字符变体。普通的 API 只处理ASCII字符，国际化应用受限。应该尽可能地使用宽字符 API 。
在 3.3 版更改: Operations in this module now raise OSError where IOError
was raised.
Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime.  Raises
OSError on failure.  The locked region of the file extends from the
current file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond the end of the
file.  mode must be one of the LK_* constants listed below. Multiple
regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but may not overlap.  Adjacent
regions are not merged; they must be unlocked individually.
Raises an auditing event msvcrt.locking with arguments fd, mode, nbytes.
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, the program
immediately tries again after 1 second.  If, after 10 attempts, the bytes cannot
be locked, OSError is raised.
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, OSError is
raised.
Unlocks the specified bytes, which must have been previously locked.
Set the line-end translation mode for the file descriptor fd. To set it to
text mode, flags should be os.O_TEXT; for binary, it should be
os.O_BINARY.
Create a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle.  The flags
parameter should be a bitwise OR of os.O_APPEND, os.O_RDONLY,
and os.O_TEXT.  The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter
to os.fdopen() to create a file object.
Raises an auditing event msvcrt.open_osfhandle with arguments handle, flags.
Return the file handle for the file descriptor fd.  Raises OSError if
fd is not recognized.
Raises an auditing event msvcrt.get_osfhandle with argument fd.
Return True if a keypress is waiting to be read.
Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string.
Nothing is echoed to the console.  This call will block if a keypress
is not already available, but will not wait for Enter to be
pressed. If the pressed key was a special function key, this will
return '\000' or '\xe0'; the next call will return the keycode.
The Control-C keypress cannot be read with this function.
Wide char variant of getch(), returning a Unicode value.
Similar to getch(), but the keypress will be echoed if it  represents a
printable character.
Wide char variant of getche(), returning a Unicode value.
Print the byte string char to the console without buffering.
Wide char variant of putch(), accepting a Unicode value.
Cause the byte string char to be "pushed back" into the console buffer;
it will be the next character read by getch() or getche().
Wide char variant of ungetch(), accepting a Unicode value.
Force the malloc() heap to clean itself up and return unused blocks to
the operating system.  On failure, this raises OSError.
